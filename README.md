# RT
this is a very simple raytracer from the 'create a raytracer from scratch' youtube series.
Creating a raytracer is no simple task.

I would not recommend using the method I used. this was simply to check if I am able to build a Ray tracer. 
If you want to build a RT have a look at CUDA programming or even how to use the newer RT cores of the GPU.
